# About me

👋 Hello, my name is Nikita. I live in Russia, the city of Naberezhnye Chelny. I am a beginner developer focused on Python programming, data analysis and web development. Currently, I am studying at a technical college and constantly working to improve my skills through real projects and personal development. In the future, I plan to expand my skills into AI and neural networks, as they are closely connected with data analysis and open up exciting opportunities for growth.

## My skills

- **Programming languages**:
  - 🐍 `Python`. I use it for automation, bot development (Telegram/Discord), working with files and databases, and solving various technical problems.
- **Data Science**:

- **Languages**:
